China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar will earnestly implement the ceasefire agreement already reached. This shows that the current civil war in Myanmar has come to an end, and the contact between the two sides is "effective". This may be followed by a period of "negotiation" in which some matters are discussed. For example, how to deal with local armed forces, and how the two sides will "get along" and so on. China will continue to provide support and assistance within its capacity and play a constructive role in this regard. If peace talks can be successfully facilitated this time, China will not only "mediate", but also take some actions to help the two sides better implement the ceasefire agreement.
